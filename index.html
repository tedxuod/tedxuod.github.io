            <h2>TED: Ideas Worth Spreading </h2>

            <p>TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth
                Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California
                30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with
                multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite
                the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18
                minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made
                available, free, at <a href="http://www.ted.com"
                                       target='_blank'>ted.com</a>
            </p>
            </br></br></br>
            <h2>TEDx, x = Independently Organized Event</h2>

            <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
                local, self-organized events that bring people together to
                share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks
                video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
                connection.

                theoretical physics at the Universities of Oxford and Manchester,
                and then pursued research in complex systems as a postdoctoral
                scholar in Europe and the US. Since 2000 he has applied theoretical
                physics ideas to the life sciences and, prior to moving to Dundee in
                2011, he held academic positions at the University of Virginia and

                biological scales, from ecology to embryo development to cell and
                molecular biology. His current research is heavily focused on
                cancer progression. From 2011-2014 he served as the Editor-in-Chief
                of the journal Physical Biology. He has served on numerous panels
                and boards in the US and the UK and continually strives to nurture
                interdisciplinary research and education at the interface between
                the physical sciences and the life sciences.</p>

                Computational Vision in the School of Computing, University of
                Dundee, and an Honorary Clinical Researcher at Ninewells Hospital
                and Medical School. His 30-year research has covered applications of
                computer vision to manufacturing, subsea robotics, immersive
                videoconferencing, and medical image analysis, funded by UK research
                councils, EU programmes, charities (e.g. the Royal Society, the
                Leverhulme Trust) and industry (incl. continuous funding from OPTOS
                plc since 2002).
                Current medical image analysis research includes vision for robotic
                hydrocolonoscopy (EU ERC "CODIR"), the analysis of whole-body MR
                angiographic data (with Toshiba Edinburgh), and the VAMPIRE
                initiative (Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for images of
                the REtina), an international collaboration of 10 image processing
                and clinical centres which he co-leads with Dr Tom MacGillivray of
                the Clinical Research Imaging Centre, University of Edinburgh.
                VAMPIRE has been growing a software suite for efficient,
                semi-automatic analysis of retinal images (vasculature
                quantification, lesions), in use for retinal biomarker studies on,
                among others, cardiovascular risk, stroke, cognitive performance,
                neurodegenerative diseases, dementia, and genetics. VAMPIRE was the
                first automatic system ever applied to UK Biobank retinal images.
                Emanuele has published more than 160 refereed papers and co-authored
                two textbooks, one of which ("Introductory techniques for 3-D

                <h4>How would you like to make a difference?</h4>
                <blockquote><p> I firmly believe that research has at
                    least two key dimensions.
                    One is the technical challenge of advancing knowledge;
                    discovering new facts about the world, introducing new
                    technologies, and how all this can be used to benefit society.
                    The other is the human dimension of research: the fact that
                    research is carried out by people, who bring great richness to a
                    group as individuals, with their histories, their experiences
                    and their personalities. A group of people is so much more than
                    their technical skills, however excellent. I am fascinated by
                    this dimension of research, and strive to make my own research
                    group not only a success in terms of publications, grants and
                    awards, but also a community in which individuals learn to
                    share, laugh and flourish as scientists and as persons.
                    I hope to be able to put across this message as inspiringly as
                    possible!</p></blockquote>
